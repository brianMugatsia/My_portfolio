About Me

I am a passionate software developer with hands-on experience in building full-stack applications using Java Spring Boot for backend development and React.js for modern, interactive user interfaces. I enjoy turning ideas into functional, user-friendly applications and continuously improving my skills by working on real-world projects.

Technical Skills

I have a strong foundation in Java and backend development using Spring Boot, where I build RESTful APIs, handle database integration, and implement business logic efficiently. On the frontend, I work with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React.js to create responsive and dynamic user interfaces, enhanced with Bootstrap for clean and consistent design.

Full-Stack Development

I am comfortable working across the full stack, connecting frontend applications to backend services, managing data flow, and ensuring smooth communication between client and server. I have experience integrating APIs, handling form submissions, validating user input, and working with relational databases.

 Learning & Growth

I am always eager to learn new technologies and improve my development practices. I actively explore best coding standards, version control with Git and GitHub, and modern development workflows. I enjoy solving problems, debugging issues, and refining applications to be more efficient and maintainable.

Projects

This GitHub profile contains projects that demonstrate my skills in Spring Boot, React.js, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. Each project reflects my approach to problem-solving, clean code, and practical software development. I am continuously updating this repository as I grow and take on new challenges.
